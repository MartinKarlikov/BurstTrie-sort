# BurstTrie-sort

BurstSort algorithm on the base of the Trie-structure.
Implements the same structure , the only difference are the *leaves* - TrieNodes changed to buckets.
The buckets burst when a amount of contained words is reached. **TODO: change the sorting algorithm in the buckets
and compare the sorting speed**

For now smaller buckets = faster algorithm, but more space is used up.

**TODO: add a contains and size functions**
**TODO: add comments explaining the code**
